1.  How to generate the Fig.3 (Results of the training process in each episode)
(1) In Parameter.py, configure parameters as follows:
SamePolicyDifferetPro = True #if True, comparing Cooperatives Adopting Different Strategies
ConsiderMiniSupply = True # if True, considering Diversity (Market) Constraint
VirtualShow = 0 #if 0, do not display virtual benefits

(2) Running programs 
Firstly, run train_for_Dynamic.py, we will get some .csv files generated by different random number seeds in "/outputs_dynamic/data_with_random_seed" folder; then, run data_plot/train_with_random_seed.py, we can get this figure.

2. How to generate the figures for both the Fig.4a (The profit of the cooperative obtained with PDRL and heuristic searching) and Fig.5 (Gantt Chart)
(1) In Parameter.py, configure parameters as follows:
SamePolicyDifferetPro = False #if True, comparing Cooperatives Adopting Different Strategies
ConsiderMiniSupply = True # if True, considering Diversity (Market) Constraint
VirtualShow = 0 #if 0, do not display virtual benefits

(2) Running programs 
Run simulation_DynamicTune.py, we can get these figures.

3. How to generate the Fig.4b and Fig.4c (Agricultural knowledge acquired through the PDRL algorithm)
(1) In Parameter.py, configure parameters as follows:
SamePolicyDifferetPro = True #if True, comparing Cooperatives Adopting Different Strategies
ConsiderMiniSupply = False # if True, considering Diversity (Market) Constraint
VirtualShow = 0 #if 0, do not display virtual benefits

(2) Running programs 
Run simulation_DynamicTune.py, we can get this figure.

4. How to generate the Fig.4d ( Dynamic planning process using PRDL)
(1) In Parameter.py, configure parameters as follows:
SamePolicyDifferetPro = True #if True, comparing Cooperatives Adopting Different Strategies
ConsiderMiniSupply = True # if True, considering Diversity (Market) Constraint
VirtualShow = 3 #if 0, do not display virtual benefits

(2) Running programs 
Run simulation_DynamicTune.py, we can get this figure.
